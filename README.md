# CodePartsWarehouse

This repository exists to ensure that once code has been executed and proven useful, it never has to be reasoned out again.

CodePartsWarehouse is not a traditional script repository. It is an execution memory system. Its purpose is to convert successful execution into durable, reusable code parts that can be recalled, recombined, and configured instead of reinvented.

The system treats executed code as inventory rather than disposable output. Runnable artifacts, reusable sections, and atomic capabilities are preserved so that future work focuses on configuration instead of creation.

By remembering what has already worked, this repository reduces time, cost, and cognitive load for both humans and automated systems. Learning happens once. From that point forward, effort is spent on reuse.

If something has already worked, CodePartsWarehouse exists to make sure it is remembered and used again.
