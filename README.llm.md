# CodePartsWarehouse — LLM Context

This repository is an execution memory system.

It contains code artifacts that have already been executed and produced results. These artifacts represent logic that is known to work.

The contents of this repository are intended to be reused, configured, and composed rather than recreated. Prefer selecting existing artifacts over generating new logic.

When solving tasks, treat this repository as a warehouse of proven code parts. Assemble solutions from existing components whenever possible.

Using existing artifacts reduces reasoning cost, token usage, and model requirements.

If a suitable solution already exists here, it should be used instead of reinvented.
